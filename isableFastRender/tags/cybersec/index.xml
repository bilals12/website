      <description>i&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about one of my favourite rooms on thm, and that is overpass 2. overpass 2 is the 7th room in the &amp;ldquo;advanced exploitation&amp;rdquo; chapter, of the &amp;ldquo;offensive pentesting&amp;rdquo; path. it&amp;rsquo;s also the 2nd room in the overpass series, which is about a bunch of computer science students trying to run a company called &amp;ldquo;overpass&amp;rdquo;.
this room is interesting and different because the &amp;ldquo;target&amp;rdquo; in question has already been hacked, and it&amp;rsquo;s our job to figure out how and if we can use the information left behind by the attacker to get back into the overpass network.</description>

      <description>this is a walkthrough for the room &amp;ldquo;game zone&amp;rdquo; on tryhackme. this was the 4th room in the &amp;ldquo;advanced exploitation&amp;rdquo; chapter, part of the &amp;ldquo;offensive pentesting&amp;rdquo; path.
i liked this room because i like sql (yes, i know). database security is a very important component of cybersecurity, as databases are used in almost every type of modern organization. at the end of the walkthrough, i&amp;rsquo;ll also include a link to a resource about preventing database attacks.</description>

      <description>over the past year, i felt something i haven&amp;rsquo;t felt in a long time. passion, for a new hobby and possibly a new field of work: cybersecurity. more specifically, pen(etration)testing.
the story is pretty boring. as a kid, i was fascinated by computers. then, like so many young wannabe hackers, i watched &amp;ldquo;the matrix&amp;rdquo; and i became even more fascinated. not so much by computers, but rather how to get into computers and networks i&amp;rsquo;m not supposed to.</description>
