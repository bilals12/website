      <description>corporate networks face a constant and ever-evolving array of threats. at the heart of many enterprise IT infrastructures lies Active Directory [AD]. this is a directory service developed by Microsoft that provides authentication (AuthC) and authorization (AuthZ) services. AD is ubiquitous because of its robust capabilities in managing users, groups, computers, and access to resources across large-scale networks.
this also makes it a prime target for attackers. a successful attack on an org&amp;rsquo;s AD can lead to data breaches, intellectual property theft, or complete takeover of the corporate infrastructure.</description>

      <description>LATRODECTUS is an emerging malware loader that i first encountered during my research at the start of 2024. initially discovered by walmart&amp;rsquo;s security team, it quickly gained attention due to the similarities it held with ICEDID, particularly in the use of a command handler for downloading and executing encrypted payloads. proofpoint and team cymru both established a link between the network infrastructure used by operators of both LATRODECTUS and ICEDID, suggesting a common origin.</description>

      <description>if you ever find yourself in between jobs for an extended period of time, remember to take time off from bouncing from constantly worrying to being completely nihilistic. if you can spare the time and energy, it can be quite rewarding to find something that you can totally nerd out on. for me, it was the world of windows malware.
this could probably benefit from being part of a series, so i&amp;rsquo;ll keep the contents of this post focused on the title.</description>

      <description>as part of a post-layoff glow-up, i began to delve deeper into programming and building my own tools. a lot of these tools are based on specific actions, like attacks, analysis, etc. one thing i&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with though is object-oriented programming used to build applications from the ground up, specifically backdoors.
backdoors are often used for securing remote access to a computer. they&amp;rsquo;re used for legitimate purposes, like by system administrators for system management (fix issues, install updates, perform maintenance) without being physically present.</description>
