      <description>as part of a post-layoff glow-up, i began to delve deeper into programming and building my own tools. a lot of these tools are based on specific actions, like attacks, analysis, etc. one thing i&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with though is object-oriented programming used to build applications from the ground up, specifically backdoors.
backdoors are often used for securing remote access to a computer. they&amp;rsquo;re used for legitimate purposes, like by system administrators for system management (fix issues, install updates, perform maintenance) without being physically present.</description>

      <description>i was poking around old vulnerabilities, that specifically affected home networks and i found this (now patched) exploitable vulnerability affecting zynOS routers. the vulnerability allows an attacker to download the router&amp;rsquo;s configuration (ROM-0 file) without any type of authentication. this file could then be later decompressed to expose the router&amp;rsquo;s admin password, wifi password, etc.
the program i wrote attempts to connect to a valid host to download said ROM-0 file, extracts specific data from it (using regex), then logs back into the same host via telnet to change DNS settings, set a system password, and log out.</description>

      <description>a fun aspect of pentesting is finding interesting ways to get authenticated sessions running. usually, a session authentication relies on the user entering some kind of key (password) that corresponds to their user ID (username). however, in some cases an attacker can &amp;ldquo;revive&amp;rdquo; sessions using just the session cookies.
i wrote cookieJar for exactly this purpose: extracting cookies from various browsers (and factor in the OS) and then use them to create authenticated sessions.</description>

      <description>since splurging on a new macbook m3 pro, that came with a 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU, 16-core neural engine, and 36GB of RAM, i thought to myself: i should probably use this to train some version of a local AI (LLM) i can use to boost my security and hacking toolchains, namely SAST/DAST and vulnerability scanning. thus began my journey into acquiring the perfect flavours of AI that were ideal for how i work (iteratively but in bursts, and lots of back and forth).</description>

      <description>a number of years ago, i received advice that would deeply change my outlook on engineering and understanding of technology.
if you want to understand how something works, build it.
at the time, i was a little too impatient to actually grasp the nuances of such advice, because i had the immediate gratification of well-built programs and tools to carry out whatever tasks i needed to. but as i delved deeper into security and pentesting, i understood that not everything is as well understood by everyone as i had once thought.</description>

      <description>earlier this week, while trawling through forums looking for malware and worm samples, i was surprised to find a rather intriguing, but hideous, slab of code. the source was a private channel for hackers of presumably israeli origin, and the script itself was part of a fully functional DDoS suite, including a .exe file for windows systems as well as a .apk for android smartphones. running the script from a *nix system seems simple enough:</description>

      <description>over the past few days, i&amp;rsquo;ve been writing tools that automate cumbersome manual tasks and make my workflow/toolchain cleaner and pushing them to my personal github. the latest one in this series is a tool i call gdbExtract.
as a security researcher, i spend a lot of time diving deep into the worlds of software security and system analysis. in these domains, binary analysis and reverse engineering are critical tasks, but their challenging and complex nature can come across as intimidating.</description>

      <description>lately, i&amp;rsquo;ve been getting more and more into reverse engineering executable programs and using them to gain control of a target machine. it brings to mind what i learned in &amp;ldquo;microcontrollers and microprocessors&amp;rdquo;, a really interesting but tough course i took in my 3rd year of electrical engineering. the course dealt with low-level computing, mainly assembly language (aka ASM), and how it&amp;rsquo;s used to communicate directly with computer architecture and control the usage of memory, on a hardware level.</description>

      <description>if you&amp;rsquo;ve worked in any sort of SaaS/tech company, odds are you&amp;rsquo;ve used a CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment) and DevOps tool. CI/CD is a method used to deliver apps to customers and clients by introducing automation into the stages of app development. it allows orgs to ship software &amp;ldquo;quickly&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;efficiently&amp;rdquo; (i used scare quotes because&amp;hellip;well, if you&amp;rsquo;ve worked in a software company you&amp;rsquo;ll know why). i&amp;rsquo;m going to see if i can try to exploit a common security misconfiguration on one of these tools, jenkins, then try to escalate privilege to get full system access.</description>
