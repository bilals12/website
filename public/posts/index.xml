      <description>corporate networks face a constant and ever-evolving array of threats. at the heart of many enterprise IT infrastructures lies Active Directory [AD]. this is a directory service developed by Microsoft that provides authentication (AuthC) and authorization (AuthZ) services. AD is ubiquitous because of its robust capabilities in managing users, groups, computers, and access to resources across large-scale networks.
this also makes it a prime target for attackers. a successful attack on an org&amp;rsquo;s AD can lead to data breaches, intellectual property theft, or complete takeover of the corporate infrastructure.</description>

      <description>LATRODECTUS is an emerging malware loader that i first encountered during my research at the start of 2024. initially discovered by walmart&amp;rsquo;s security team, it quickly gained attention due to the similarities it held with ICEDID, particularly in the use of a command handler for downloading and executing encrypted payloads. proofpoint and team cymru both established a link between the network infrastructure used by operators of both LATRODECTUS and ICEDID, suggesting a common origin.</description>

      <description>if you ever find yourself in between jobs for an extended period of time, remember to take time off from bouncing from constantly worrying to being completely nihilistic. if you can spare the time and energy, it can be quite rewarding to find something that you can totally nerd out on. for me, it was the world of windows malware.
this could probably benefit from being part of a series, so i&amp;rsquo;ll keep the contents of this post focused on the title.</description>

      <description>as part of a post-layoff glow-up, i began to delve deeper into programming and building my own tools. a lot of these tools are based on specific actions, like attacks, analysis, etc. one thing i&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated with though is object-oriented programming used to build applications from the ground up, specifically backdoors.
backdoors are often used for securing remote access to a computer. they&amp;rsquo;re used for legitimate purposes, like by system administrators for system management (fix issues, install updates, perform maintenance) without being physically present.</description>

      <description>a fun aspect of pentesting is finding interesting ways to get authenticated sessions running. usually, a session authentication relies on the user entering some kind of key (password) that corresponds to their user ID (username). however, in some cases an attacker can &amp;ldquo;revive&amp;rdquo; sessions using just the session cookies.
i wrote cookieJar for exactly this purpose: extracting cookies from various browsers (and factor in the OS) and then use them to create authenticated sessions.</description>

      <description>since splurging on a new macbook m3 pro, that came with a 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU, 16-core neural engine, and 36GB of RAM, i thought to myself: i should probably use this to train some version of a local AI (LLM) i can use to boost my security and hacking toolchains, namely SAST/DAST and vulnerability scanning. thus began my journey into acquiring the perfect flavours of AI that were ideal for how i work (iteratively but in bursts, and lots of back and forth).</description>

      <description>a number of years ago, i received advice that would deeply change my outlook on engineering and understanding of technology.
if you want to understand how something works, build it.
at the time, i was a little too impatient to actually grasp the nuances of such advice, because i had the immediate gratification of well-built programs and tools to carry out whatever tasks i needed to. but as i delved deeper into security and pentesting, i understood that not everything is as well understood by everyone as i had once thought.</description>

      <description>earlier this week, while trawling through forums looking for malware and worm samples, i was surprised to find a rather intriguing, but hideous, slab of code. the source was a private channel for hackers of presumably israeli origin, and the script itself was part of a fully functional DDoS suite, including a .exe file for windows systems as well as a .apk for android smartphones. running the script from a *nix system seems simple enough:</description>

      <description>over the past few days, i&amp;rsquo;ve been writing tools that automate cumbersome manual tasks and make my workflow/toolchain cleaner and pushing them to my personal github. the latest one in this series is a tool i call gdbExtract.
as a security researcher, i spend a lot of time diving deep into the worlds of software security and system analysis. in these domains, binary analysis and reverse engineering are critical tasks, but their challenging and complex nature can come across as intimidating.</description>
