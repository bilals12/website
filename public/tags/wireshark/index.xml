      <description>i&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about one of my favourite rooms on thm, and that is overpass 2. overpass 2 is the 7th room in the &amp;ldquo;advanced exploitation&amp;rdquo; chapter, of the &amp;ldquo;offensive pentesting&amp;rdquo; path. it&amp;rsquo;s also the 2nd room in the overpass series, which is about a bunch of computer science students trying to run a company called &amp;ldquo;overpass&amp;rdquo;.
this room is interesting and different because the &amp;ldquo;target&amp;rdquo; in question has already been hacked, and it&amp;rsquo;s our job to figure out how and if we can use the information left behind by the attacker to get back into the overpass network.</description>
