      <description>&lt;p&gt;i&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about one of my favourite rooms on thm, and that is overpass 2. overpass 2 is the 7th room in the &amp;ldquo;advanced exploitation&amp;rdquo; chapter, of the &amp;ldquo;offensive pentesting&amp;rdquo; path. it&amp;rsquo;s also the 2nd room in the overpass series, which is about a bunch of computer science students trying to run a company called &amp;ldquo;overpass&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this room is interesting and different because the &amp;ldquo;target&amp;rdquo; in question has already been hacked, and it&amp;rsquo;s our job to figure out how and if we can use the information left behind by the attacker to get back into the overpass network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;this is a walkthrough for the room &amp;ldquo;game zone&amp;rdquo; on tryhackme. this was the 4th room in the &amp;ldquo;advanced exploitation&amp;rdquo; chapter, part of the &amp;ldquo;offensive pentesting&amp;rdquo; path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i liked this room because i like sql (yes, i know). database security is a very important component of cybersecurity, as databases are used in almost every type of modern organization. at the end of the walkthrough, i&amp;rsquo;ll also include a link to a resource about preventing database attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
