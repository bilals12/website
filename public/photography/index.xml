      <description>first time running with the cinestill 400d. it&amp;rsquo;s quite a finicky film, and i&amp;rsquo;m not sure i have the skill or patience (yet) to deal with its many quirks.</description>

      <description>this was my first roll of black + white film. i have to say, i had a lot of fun shooting with it because i wasn&amp;rsquo;t preoccupied with colour and got to focus instead on the moods and shadows of the shots.
people here&amp;rsquo;s my friend sib, writing a message to his friend.
my girlfriend joey.
events these next few shots are from a protest in toronto. thousands of people had gathered to speak out against the horrific crimes of the zionist occupation of palestine.</description>

      <description>portra 800 is probably my favourite film to shoot with. once i&amp;rsquo;d gotten comfortable enough with the gold 200, i wanted to elevate my colour game with a more light sensitive film and this one is definitely up there.
people some shots of friends: sib + kubba, hyder, nisan, and natasha.
bonus one of joey. it came out a bit dark, but i kind of like it. also found this one i took of sib having a smoke on a rainy day.</description>

      <description>more work with the gold 200, my first and favourite film (until i discovered portra 800 at least).
wrapping up the month of october. warm, sunny days and the leaves just starting to change.</description>

      <description>the last roll of the manitoba trip. even though it&amp;rsquo;s a technically &amp;ldquo;inferior&amp;rdquo; film, i still love the gold 200 and these shots are some of my favourites.</description>

      <description>second roll for the manitoba trip. first time shooting with the portra 800, and it turned out great (even if some shots are blurry).</description>

      <description>first time shooting with ultramax 400. the colours seem a little cooler than the gold 200, and definitely not as rich as the portra 800, but i do like the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; feel of some of these photos.
it was also the first of 3 rolls i took along with me on my trip to manitoba, so the photos are a mix of toronto and manitoba scenes.</description>

      <description>still practicing. stuck with the gold 200 because it&amp;rsquo;s a low-cost film, and nice for summer days.</description>

      <description>my first ever roll of film + my first ever analog camera. during the summer, i became increasingly disillusioned with our (my) over-dependence on technology, especially given both my career and hobbies are steeped in digitalia. i decided to shoot film, and was able to find a great deal for an intermediate analog camera: the Asahi Pentax Spotmatic SPII. with it came 3 lenses: a 35mm Zeiss Zebra, a 55m SMC Takumar (pictured), and a 135mm long.</description>
