      <description>this was my first roll of black + white film. i have to say, i had a lot of fun shooting with it because i wasn&amp;rsquo;t preoccupied with colour and got to focus instead on the moods and shadows of the shots.
people here&amp;rsquo;s my friend sib, writing a message to his friend.
my girlfriend joey.
events these next few shots are from a protest in toronto. thousands of people had gathered to speak out against the horrific crimes of the zionist occupation of palestine.</description>

      <description>portra 800 is probably my favourite film to shoot with. once i&amp;rsquo;d gotten comfortable enough with the gold 200, i wanted to elevate my colour game with a more light sensitive film and this one is definitely up there.
people some shots of friends: sib + kubba, hyder, nisan, and natasha.
bonus one of joey. it came out a bit dark, but i kind of like it. also found this one i took of sib having a smoke on a rainy day.</description>
