cracks in the asphalt, cracks in the curb

cracks in the sidewalk, cracks in the doors

cracks in the walls and cracks in the floor


cracks in the glass, cracks in the steel

cracks in the marble and cracks in the pillars


crack my eyes open to see a little more


cracks in my hands, cracks in my feet

cracks in my smile, cracks in my face

cracks in my youth and cracks in my world


cracks in the earth, cracks in the ways

cracks in the stairs, between me and You


i move inwards, towards the cracks in my psyche

hoping to trip and hold on to You


but i don't


i slip through the cracks
