# **experience** 
### *software security engineer + researcher @ [Trustwave SpiderLabs](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/company/about-us/spiderlabs/)*

- investigated **attacks and vulnerabilities** for key clients in telecommunications, energy, and national security.

- provided Core Engineering with actionable research data to develop **deep protection against threats** based on business needs and **GRC** requirements.

- designed test-beds for observing backend and container orchestration architecture, following **SSDLC** and **AppSec** best practices (**RRAs, tech + architecture design reviews, STRIDE threat modeling** [of the app and post-deployment], and **code reviews**).

- developed a vulnerability management engine for continuous identification + discovery, triaging, reporting, remediation, and tracking, (in **C#, .NET, Python**), with **600+** Python check scripts and **96** framework scripts.

- created an **automation tool** to support the vulnerability management program, in **Ruby**, using **Ruby on Rails** for **RESTful APIs**, **OAuth 2.0 + JWTs** for AuthZ, and **OpenID Connect** for AuthC, with data stored in **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)** and later **MongoDB**, deployed on **ECS**.

- built an **aggregator tool** to parse security advisories and support new platforms with **threat intelligence** and develop new **automation patterns and algorithms** to provide **critical patch updates** to clients.

- integrated tooling into **CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins,ECS)**, optimizing workflow by **65%**, calculating **severities**, enforcing **SLAs**, and tracking **vulnerabilities**. Defined **specific KPIs** and reported progress to the C-suite using metrics collected via the above programs.

- **researched** modern **TTPs**, including **reverse engineering of malware collected via honeypot recon**, to bolster Trustwave’s product offerings and its own **security posture**.




### *lead database developer @ [Veryon](https://veryon.com/)*

- authored, validated, and maintained high-quality, **guided troubleshooting solutions** for a **reasoning engine** based on several maintenance manuals for a variety of equipment and systems.

- developed entire **libraries and databases** for dataset ingestion, automated **RFIs** via **Powershell scripts**, and created **Tableau data visualizations** of **usage analytics** for both internal and client-side purposes.




# **education**
### *bachelor of engineering @ [Western U](https://www.eng.uwo.ca/)*
majored in electrical and computer engineering, with a specialization in information communication and transmission.
