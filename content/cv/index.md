# **work experience** 
### *database security researcher @ [Trustwave SpiderLabs](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/company/about-us/spiderlabs/)*

- responsible for *discovery and investigation* of the latest *attacks and vulnerabilities* pertaining to **17** (and counting) major relational database management systems on behalf of our clients, who occupied key sectors such as *telecommunications*, *energy*, and *national security* & *defense*. 

- provided the engineering team with *hard technical research* and data gleaned from the *vulnerability assessment engine* and other *automation platform*, based on various needs communicated by the product team, to develop *full protection* against *current and future threats*. 

- developed and improved our *vulnerability assessment engine*, by adding over **300** unique check scripts and over **66** framework scripts. the engine is implemented in **C#**, running under the .NET platform, and uses **IronPython** to execute Python scripts (checks) that *look for vulnerabilities* and *report the findings* in an **event-driven** manner. 

- developed and tested our *automation platform* that *parses software vendor security advisories (ETL)* and extends project functionality to better support new platforms, by leveraging *vast amounts of threat intelligence* and telemetry data to *develop new automation patterns* and algorithms and *provide critical patch updates* to clients. 

- closely studied the most current DISA-STIGs and CIS Benchmarks to close any gaps in our clientsâ€™ compliance requirements. Personally added detection and support for **MongoDB 4.x/5.x/6.x**, **PostgreSQL 13.x**, **MariaDB 10.x**, **Oracle 12c**, and more. 

- in-depth research of whitepapers, statistics, conference presentations and blog articles to bolster both work-related and individual research efforts. published internal research pertaining to **MongoDB Buffer Overflows**, **Honeypots and Malware Analysis**, **Attacks on the Healthcare Sector**, and more. 




### *lead database developer @ [Veryon](https://veryon.com/)*
- authored, validated, and maintained high-quality, guided troubleshooting solutions for a reasoning engine based on several maintenance manuals for a variety of equipment and systems. 

- developed entire libraries and databases, Powershell scripts, and Tableau data visualizations to collect analytics and deliver engagement reports to our clients. 
Worked well with a wide range of personalities and roles, and actively participated in project roadmaps and discussions, providing technical suggestions, including estimates and priorities. 

- gained ability to be flexible to shifting priorities and workloads, and to work on multiple time-sensitive projects. 




# **education**
### *bachelor of engineering @ [Western U](https://www.eng.uwo.ca/)*
majored in electrical and computer engineering, with a specialization in information communication and transmission.
