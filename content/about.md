i'm bilal. 

i'm a former software developer, current security researcher, and aspiring penetration tester currently living in dubai. 
i was born in india, grew up in the uae, moved to canada and then moved back. 

this website is a little corner of the internet i've carved out for myself to share my internal monologue with the world (or whoever's looking, at least).

thanks for coming!
