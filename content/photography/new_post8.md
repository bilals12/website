my first ever roll of film + my first ever analog camera. during the summer, i became increasingly disillusioned with our (my) over-dependence on technology, especially given both my career and hobbies are steeped in digitalia. i decided to shoot film, and was able to find a great deal for an intermediate analog camera: the Asahi Pentax Spotmatic SPII. with it came 3 lenses: a 35mm Zeiss Zebra, a 55m SMC Takumar (pictured), and a 135mm long.

i fell in love with it immediately, and started shooting. the great (and maybe frustrating) thing about shooting film is the most obvious: you have no idea it's going to turn out until you scan. so i spent a lot of time trying to understand the basics: aperture, shutter speed, ISO, focal distance, etc. i tried to be as intentional as possible when shooting, as opposed to the rapid fire nature of digital, phone photography.
