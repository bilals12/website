this was my first roll of black + white film. i have to say, i had a lot of fun shooting with it because i wasn't preoccupied with colour and got to focus instead on the moods and shadows of the shots. 

## people

## the city

toronto looks really nice in BW. parts of the city are already quite grim, but on a sunny day the images look particularly striking.
