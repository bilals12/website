first time shooting with ultramax 400. the colours seem a little cooler than the gold 200, and definitely not as rich as the portra 800, but i do like the "real" feel of some of these photos.

it was also the first of 3 rolls i took along with me on my trip to manitoba, so the photos are a mix of toronto and manitoba scenes.
